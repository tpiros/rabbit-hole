Please run `npm run install` from your cli - this will setup the dependencies for both the backend and the frontend.

Remember to add `GEMINI_API_KEY=""` and `TRIGGER_SECRET_KEY=""` to `backend/.env` and `TRIGGER_SECRET_KEY` to `frontend/.env`.

After that run `npm start` which should start both the backend and frontend.
